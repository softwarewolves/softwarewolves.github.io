###History

A summary of the major milestones in the history of Softwarewolves:

* [Peter Doomen](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-doomen/1/460/33) originally had the idea to turn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">werewolf party game</a> into a coding contest and proposed a session at [Agile Open Benelux 2011](http://www.agileopen.net/agile-open-belgium-2011).

* Johan Peeters won the day and found the concept so intriguing, he proposed the session together with Peter for [XPDays Benelux 2011](http://www.xpday.be/Xpday2011/sessions/Agile%20Werewolves.html).

* The winners, Alexander Helleboogh and Nelis Bouck&eacute;, were again enthralled, jumped on the band wagon and helped to create the [XPDays Benelux 2012](http://www.xpday.be/Xpday2012/public_program/sessions/91/public.html) edition.
By this time, the session had morphed: we provided a game engine that runs in an XMPP village and participants were asked to write villager and werewolf bots in the language of their choice.
Using XMPP as a backbone allowed conversations between bots implemented in different technologies.


* Even though XMPP is a simple technology, it proved challenging to master the basics given the time pressure during the contest. That is why we provided basic bots that incorporate the required XMPP operations in some of the most popular languages for the next presentation at [Mini XPDays 2013](http://www.xpdays.net/Xpday2013/Mini%20XPDay/Program.html#session_91): Node.js, Java, C#. [Rob Westgeest](http://www.westgeest-consultancy.com/) kindly donated a Ruby basic bot.

* The session was further refined at [Co-Learning](http://www.co-learning.be/Gameday) in May 2013

* The session went international at [SPA 2013](http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/sessions/session499.html) in June 2013.

In September 2013, Alexander, Nelis and Johan decided to offer the coding contest commercially as an in-house team-building event for developers.
