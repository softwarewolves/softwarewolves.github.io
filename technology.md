###Technology

The underlying technology used for the Softwarewolves game is the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP). Bot players are XMPP clients, and connect to an XMPP server running the game engine. XMPP enables connecting bot players written in different languages and technologies.

We provide basic bot implementations that encapsulate the XMPP-protocol, so play can commence with minimal technical requirements. Prior XMPP knowledge is not required to build a bot for Softwarewolves. Basic bots are available in the following programming languages:
- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Scala

Other languages available on request.
 
###Infastructure
Our state-of-the-art game server is a raspberry pi that runs ejabberd, requiring less energy per hour than a jumbo jet in a millisecond.
