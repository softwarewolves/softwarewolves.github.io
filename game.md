The Game
========

Werewolves
----------

Softwarewolves is inspired by the well-know party game [Werewolves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game): 
- the werewolves game models a battle between an informed minority (the werewolves) and an uninformed majority (the townspeople). Players are secretly assigned roles: either werewolves, who know each other; or townspeople, who know only the number of werewolves amongst them. 
- In the game's night phase the werewolves covertly "murder" a townsperson. During the day phase, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been eliminated, or until the werewolves outnumber the townspeople. 

Softwarewolves
--------------
In softwarewolves, the game is played online over chat, involving both human an bot players. In the screenshot below you can see part of the voting round in which the villagers vote who should be hanged.

As a participating team, your goal is to build a bot player that participates in the game. A product owner will publish stories for specific functionalities and their corresponding reward, such as
* voting according to specific voting behaviors
* playing the role of the werewolf
* tracking the voting history of other players

Teams can earn marks by succesfully demoing one or several stories to the product owner. 


Technology
----------
The game is played over online chat. Players meet in a chatroom where the game takes place. The underlying technology used for the Softwarewolves game is [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)][1]. XMPP grew out of *Jabber* and is often referred to by that name. Players are XMPP clients, and connect to an XMPP server.

Programming
-----------
But don't worry, you don't need XMPP knownledge to play softwarewolves. We provide basic bots for that encapsulate the XMPP-protocol so that you can start with minimal technical hurdles. Basic bots are available in the following programming languates:
- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Scala
- Other languages available at request


Players are XMPP clients, but so are the game co-ordinator and the game engine.
In this coding contest, you develop an XMPP client bot that
* connects to an XMPP server, 
* tells the game co-ordinator that it wants to step into the arena,
* accepts an invitation to join a chat room where the game will play,
* votes when asked to do so by the room's moderator.

Actually, if you play your cards right and choose one of the common programming languages that we provide a basic bot for, you do not need to develop most of the above functionality - it is already there in the basic bot.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, you do not score any points in the contest for functionality already offered by the basic bot.
You only start scoring when you implement functionality requested by the product owner, such as
* follow interesting voting strategies,
* take the role of the werewolf,
* 

The basic bots are developed on top of XMPP libraries.
At some point in the contest, you are likely to have to interact with those libraries.
Similarly, if you need to build a bot from scratch, we advise that you do so on top of a library that hides many of the arcane details of XMPP.

In this document, we cannot describe the abstractions that you will encounter in the library that you have chosen or we have chosen for you.
Instead, we will give a quick overview of XMPP concepts that underly your bot operation.
Some you may not encounter.
If, on the other hand, the current description does not cover your needs, you may find what you need on [the website of the XMPP Standards Foundation][2].

establishing a connection with the server
=========================================

Clients need to present credentials to authenticate to the server.
The XMPP servers we use in the game all accept username/password credentials.

The aim of XMPP is to allow entities on the network communicate with each other in near-realtime.
As far as XMPP is concerned, an entity is defined by an account on an XMPP server.
An account has an address of the form *local-part@domainpart* e.g., *juliet@im.example.com*, which is also referred to as a *bare JID*.
An address in XMPP is called a *JID*, short for Jabber ID.
Multiple connections may be established on behalf of a single account, so there is a third element to a JID, namely the *resource*.
A full JID, then, looks like this: *local-part@domainpart/resource*.
The local part identifies the person, or bot; the domain part identifies the XMPP server on which the account resides.

In order to authenticate, the account the client is trying to log into has to exist.
So your client either needs to use an account provided to you by the contest organizers, or you need to register an account first on the target XMPP server.

When authentication with the server succeeds, the client opens an *XML Stream* that will act as a container for so-called *XML Stanzas*.
You can think of the stream as a bi-directional connection from your bot to the server and the stanzas as messages that flow over the connection.

stanzas
=======

Stanzas are XML elements that are sent within a stream. 
The 2 stanzas you will almost certainly encounter are:

* Presence
* Message

A presence stanza is sent when the status of a user changes (*Idle*, *Offline*, *Available*, *Do not disturb*, etc).

Your bot needs to send a message stanza to get the attention of the game co-ordinator (sww@someserver).

    <message to=’sww@someserver’>
        <body>I want to play</body>
    </message>

After a while, it will receive an invitation

    <message from="villageXXX@conference.someserver" to="some_bot@someserver" type="normal">
        <x xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user">
            <invite from="softwarewolf@someserver">
                <reason>come and join the werewolf game</reason>
            </invite>
        </x>
     </message>
    
which it should accept to gain access to the room by sending a Presence stanza to

    villageXXX@conference.someserver/nickname

where the bot will be shown as _nickname_ in the room.
The stanza should contain an x element with the multi-user chat namespace,

    http://jabber.org/protocol/muc

Something along the lines of

    <presence to="villageXXX@conference.someserver/Nicky">
        <x xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc"/>
    </presence>

In multi-user chat, messages do not come from a user's JID, but from the room's JID, qualified by the nickname of the originator of the message, e.g.

    <message from="villageXXX@conference.someserver/MC" to="some_bot@someserver" type="groupchat"">
        <body>Yes! The last werewolve is dead! Finally peace in the village! The villagers win.</body>
    </message>
    
Conversely, messages are sent to the room:

    <message to="villageXXX@conference.someserver" type="groupchat">
        <body>Howdy!</body>
    </message>
    
Private messages, sent by specifying a nickname after the domain part of the room JID and using the _chat_ rather than _groupchat_ type, will only be delivered to the specified nickname:

    <message to="villageXXX@conference.someserver/MC" type="chat">
        <body>I eat vegetables_only</body>
    </message>
