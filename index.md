###Challenge


Are you looking for a teambuilding event for software developers combining entertainment and learning, which is more engaging than a training session and more useful than paintball?

Softwarewolves is an in-house coding contest run for your companies' developers.
This playful session engages participants in competitive coding: pitching their programming skills against their colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants typically form pairs and implement “bot players” for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game</a>.
Players earn credits by implementing requested functionality in 4 iterations
testing market awareness, programming skills and development process.
During public demos, teams 'sell' their work and heckle competing solutions.
In the follow-on retrospective, participants reflect on the experience and learning value.

###Session objectives

- Have fun while coding
- Share programming practices in a collaborative context.
- Interact with colleagues out of the office in a playful environment.
- Adapt programming practice to achieve maximum value in a fast pace environment.
